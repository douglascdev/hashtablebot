Welcome to hashtablebot's documentation!
========================================

Welcome! Hash Table Bot is an open-source twitch bot made in Python.

It started as a pasttime to interact with users from a certain twitch channel, so it has hardcoded references to emotes that might not be available in other channels.

For now the bot is not cloud hosted, meaning you have to request your own token from twitch, configure it and run it yourself.

To get started, click :ref:`here <getting_started>`.
